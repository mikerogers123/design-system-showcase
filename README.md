# design-system-showcase

This project was generated with [UKHO Cookiecutter Angular Template](https://github.com/UKHO/cookiecutter-angular) and [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.3.

## Development server

Run `yarn run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `yarn run ng g c components/component-name` to generate a new [component](https://angular.io/guide/architecture-components). Components are "dumb" and should only receive state via inputs and emit events via outputs, allowing their re-use throughout the application.

Run `yarn run ng g c containers/container-name` to generate a new [container](https://indepth.dev/container-components-with-angular/). Containers are "smart" and can interact with services via dependency injection and components via templating. Angular treats containers as components; the distinction is simply best practice.

Run `yarn run ng g s services/service-name` to generate a new [service](https://angular.io/guide/architecture-services). Services represent any non-view-related function or feature in the application and can interact via dependency injection.

You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|guard|interface|enum|module`.

If you have installed the Angular CLI globally, you can drop the `yarn run` from the front of `ng` commands.

## Build

Run `yarn run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `yarn run test` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `yarn run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) using [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) features.## Further help
